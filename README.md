## This fork: Brazilian Portuguese

This fork translates the game into **Brazilian Portuguese** (PT-BR), with
the official Brazilian names. Build it with
`python tools/bootstrap.py --make --port-lang pt_br`; see
[Portuguese build](docs/PORTUGUESE.md) and the
[translation roadmap](docs/ROADMAP-PTBR.md). Translation: Carlos Mozart
(AllGenWiki). Original 3DS port: Daniel Cazalla.

Known issues in the Portuguese build:

- **POKéDEX:** on the screen that registers a new POKéMON, the text
  appears cut.
- Some graphics still show English words (summary page headers, the
  summary's type icons, the status icons, the POKéDEX and POKéNAV menus,
  the title logo).
- Moves with full-screen animations (SURF) cover only the GBA's 240
  pixels: a limitation of the original port.

Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen brings the adventure to Nintendo 3DS as
**native homebrew**. The game runs on the top screen, while a dedicated touch
interface on the bottom screen replaces the START menu. Enable the optional
**voxel overworld** to explore supported areas from a new angle.

## Features

| | What to expect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native 3DS homebrew** | Runs directly on the console's ARM11 using libctru, Citro2D and Citro3D, without an emulator. |
| **Two screens, one adventure** | The game on top, with a dedicated touch interface below in place of the START menu. |
| **Optional voxel overworld** | Modelled buildings, trees, signposts and terrain relief, with adjustable camera angle and zoom. |
| **Built from your own cartridge** | The builder generates the game data locally from your own dump. No ROM content is distributed. |

### A new perspective on Hoenn

The voxel overworld is **off by default**. Open **OPTION** on the bottom
screen and enable **VOXEL 3D**, then adjust **3D ANGLE** and **3D ZOOM** to
set your camera.

> **3D mode is a work in progress.** Only some buildings, trees, signposts
> and terrain relief are modelled today. Most of the map and nearly all
> interiors are still shown flat. More areas will be modelled as the
> project moves forward.

## Getting started

### Recommended: use the website

1. Open **[emerald-3ds.com](https://emerald-3ds.com/)** and follow the instructions for your console or emulator.
2. Select your **own clean, supported Pokémon Emerald ROM** in the web builder. Check the website for supported versions and languages.
3. Generate and download the game files, then follow the website's installation guide to place them correctly.
4. Complete the **sound setup** described in the guide before launching the game.

**Everything is generated in your browser. You do not need to download or install the Windows builder, Python or this repository.** You only download the resulting game files. Your ROM is processed locally in your browser and is not uploaded.

For a physical console, you need a **Nintendo 3DS / 2DS family console with custom firmware** and access to its SD card. Follow the website's instructions for the available launch methods.

### Updating or having trouble?

**Use the [website's update instructions and FAQ](https://emerald-3ds.com/) as your first stop.** Follow the steps for the version you are installing, including regenerating the data pack when required.

- **No sound?** Follow the sound setup instructions; the required DSP firmware file is separate from the generated game files.
- **Using an emulator?** Follow the emulator instructions and use its emulated SD card location.
- **Missing or incompatible data pack?** Check the installation and update instructions and make sure your files match the release.
- **Still stuck?** Check the FAQ before asking for help on Discord or opening an issue.

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: desktop builder (Windows, Linux and macOS)</strong></summary>

### Windows

1. Download `Emerald3DS-vX.Y.Z-Windows.zip` from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ZallaxDev/pokeemerald-3Ds-dualscreen/releases/latest) and extract the whole ZIP.
2. Run `Emerald3DS-Builder.exe`, choose your supported ROM and your SD card, then press **Install**.
3. Follow the [installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md), including sound setup, and launch the game from the Homebrew Launcher.

The builder writes `/3ds/emerald3ds/Emerald3DS.3dsx`, `Emerald3DS.smdh` and `emerald3ds.pak`. Your ROM is only read, not copied, uploaded or modified. The desktop builder needs no Internet connection.

### Linux and macOS

Run the builder from source with **Python 3.11+ and Pillow**, using the `payload/` folder from the matching release ZIP:

```sh
python -m emerald3ds_builder --payload /path/to/payload install --rom /path/to/rom.gba --sd /path/to/card
```

See the [builder documentation](builder/) for setup and additional commands, and the [installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for updates.

## About this repository

**This repository contains no game content.** It holds the port's own code,
the tools that build it and the builder that turns *your own* cartridge dump
into the game's data pack. Nothing derived from the ROM is distributed here or
in the releases.

| Component | Location | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Engine | [pret/pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) · [`upstream.lock`](upstream.lock) | The Pokémon Emerald decompilation, pinned to a specific revision. |
| Port patches | [`patches/pokeemerald/`](patches/pokeemerald) | The port's changes to the upstream engine. |
| 3DS backend | [`3ds_port/`](3ds_port) | ARM11 backend, GPU compositor, NDSP audio, touch UI and voxel overworld. |
| Data builder | [`builder/`](builder/) | Creates the data pack locally from the player's own supported ROM. |

## Building from source

```sh
python tools/bootstrap.py        # pinned upstream + patches + port -> build/upstream
python tools/bootstrap.py --make # also builds the 3DSX there
python tools/bootstrap.py --make --spanish-rom esmeralda.gba  # Spanish build
```

The Spanish build takes its texts and graphics from your own clean Spanish
(BPES) ROM; see [Pokémon Esmeralda en español](docs/SPANISH.md).

Start with the [development guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for requirements,
the development loop, loose data, data packs and host tests.
